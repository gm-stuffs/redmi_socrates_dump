used to overwrite the node paths mentioned in common resources file
and also to modify the Supported field information. -->

* MajorValue and MinorValue, both are required to uniquely
identify the resource.
* Node, the new node path to overwrite the already existing path
of commonresourceconfigs.xml file.
* Supported, to indicate whether the resource is supported or not.
* For each config tag, either of Node or Supported fields need
to be mentioned.
